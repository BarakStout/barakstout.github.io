* Breath! There is plenty of time.

* Use a **Pencil**

* Make sure you are familir with the [AP Comp Sci A vocabulary](vocab)

* Study [Appendix B (AKA Quick Refrence)](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-2014-java-quick-reference.pdf), it has lots of information

* For part I:
  * You will have 90 minutes to solve correctly 40 questions. That means you will have 2 minutes and 15 seconds per question.

  * Some questions will take longer than others. Identify the questions you can solve quickly first and then go back to work on the ones that will take you longer.

  * Make sure to pay attention to if-statements and loops without curly brackets. Recall that in Java, such blocks only execute one line of code in absence of curly brackets.

  * With Boolean questions, make sure to remember [De Morgan's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws): $$ \;	!(A \; \&\& \; B) == \;  !A \; \vert \vert \; !B $$

  * Speaking of Boolean questions, when in doubt, construct a [Truth Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table).

* For part II:

  * Read all 4 questions before you start working. Then start with the one that is easiest for you.

  * If the question has multiple parts, solve the parts you know. You can get full credit for part (c) of a question even if you do not solve part (a) or (b).

  * Make sure your hand writing is as neat as possible. Although you will not lose point for poor hand writing per say, however it will make the grader's life easier to give you points if they can make out what you wrote.

  * Unless directly told otherwise by the exam instructions, _do not_ use System.out.print(ln) in your response.

  * When writing methods remember:

    * Use the parameters as provided. Do not redefine parameters.

    * Make sure you return the correct data.  

  * When writing a class remember:

    * Pay attention to methods and variables that are given.

    * Make sure to pay careful attention to return types from methods within a class.

    * Make sure all you visibility modifiers are correct.

    * Make sure you use _super_ and _this_ only where needed.

    * Implement all abstract methods

    * We _implement_ interface and _extend_ classes

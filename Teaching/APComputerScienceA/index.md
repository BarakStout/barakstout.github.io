## About the Exam
{: id="about_the_exam"}

AP Computer Science A is all about Object Oriented Programming in Java. The College Board has defined the subset of Java that you need to know. It is describe in [Appendix A](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-a-java-subset.pdf) This year will be on **Friday, May 17, 2019 @ noon**. The exam has 2 parts, both are 90 minutes long.
  * Part I - 40 Multiple Choice Questions
  * Part II - 4 Free Response Questions

The exam grade is computed by a weighted formula out of 80. Each Multiple choice questions is worth 1 point. Free response questions are graded out of 9 points, totaled and then multiplied by 1.1111. The scores are than added together. You can play around with this [AP Comp Sci A Grade Calculator](https://appass.com/calculators/computerscience) to run _what_ifs_.

No computers, calculators, other devices, books, or materials are allowed, only paper, pencil and an eraser. Pens are allowed, but I highly recommend that you **use a pencil**.

## College Board Labs
{: id="college_board_labs"}

There are 3 required labs (projects) that you need to complete prior to taking the AP. You will be given plenty of time in class to complete these assignments. You will not be tested on the content of the labs, but some concepts from them may appear on the exam in different ways. Each lab has a written student guide as well as a starter code. The links to both are bellow:

* **Magpie Lab:** In this lab you will build a chat bot and get intruded to the wonderful world of [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), a field that has been growing rapidly. You will be using mostly String methods and if-statements for this lab.

  * [Magpie Lab Student Guide](http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-compscia-magpie-lab-student-guide.pdf)


* **Elevens Lab:** For this lab you will be creating a solitare like game called Elevens. The lab will walk you through the rules and at the end you will make a working version of the game including a [Graphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) (GUI).

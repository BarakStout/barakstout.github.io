# AP Computer Science A

## About the Exam
{: id="about_the_exam"}

AP Computer Science A is all about Object Oriented Programming in Java. The College Board has defined the subset of Java that you need to know. It is describe in [Appendix A](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-a-java-subset.pdf) This year will be on **Friday, May 17, 2019 @ noon**. The exam has 2 parts, both are 90 minutes long.
  * Part I - 40 Multiple Choice Questions
  * Part II - 4 Free Response Questions

The exam grade is computed by a weighted formula out of 80. Each Multiple choice questions is worth 1 point. Free response questions are graded out of 9 points, totaled and then multiplied by 1.1111. The scores are than added together. You can play around with this [AP Comp Sci A Grade Calculator](https://appass.com/calculators/computerscience) to run _what_ifs_.

No computers, calculators, other devices, books, or materials are allowed, only paper, pencil and an eraser. Pens are allowed, but I highly recommend that you **use a pencil**.

## College Board Labs
{: id="college_board_labs"}

There are 3 required labs (projects) that you need to complete prior to taking the AP. You will be given plenty of time in class to complete these assignments. You will not be tested on the content of the labs, but some concepts from them may appear on the exam in different ways. Each lab has a written student guide as well as a starter code. The links to both are bellow:

* **Magpie Lab:** In this lab you will build a chat bot and get intruded to the wonderful world of [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), a field that has been growing rapidly. You will be using mostly String methods and if-statements for this lab.

  * [Magpie Lab Student Guide](http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-compscia-magpie-lab-student-guide.pdf)


* **Elevens Lab:** For this lab you will be creating a solitare like game called Elevens. The lab will walk you through the rules and at the end you will make a working version of the game including a [Graphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) (GUI).

* **Picture Lab:** This Lab will teach you the basics of how images are stored in memory. You will learn about grayscale and RGB images and way to manipulated them.

## Mr. Stout's AP Exam Tips
{: id="Mr. Stout's AP Exam Tips"}

* Breath! There is plenty of time.

* Study [Appendix B (AKA Quick Refrence)](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-2014-java-quick-reference.pdf), it has lots of information

* For part I:
  * You will have 90 minutes to solve correctly 40 questions. That means you will have 2 minutes and 15 seconds per question.

  * Some questions will take longer than others. Identify the questions you can solve quickly first and then go back to work on the ones that will take you longer.

  * Make sure to pay attention to if-statements and loops without curly brackets. Recall that in Java, such blocks only execute one line of code in absence of curly brackets.

  * With Boolean questions, make sure to remember [De Morgan's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws): $$ \;	!(A \; \&\& \; B) == \;  !A \; \vert \vert \; !B $$

  * Speaking of Boolean questions, when in doubt, construct a [Truth Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table).

* For part II:

  * Read the entire question.

  * If the question has multiple parts, solve the parts you know. You can get full credit for part (c) of a question even if you do not solve part (a) or (b).

  * Make sure your hand writing is as neat as possible. Although you will not lose point for poor hand writing per say, however it will make the grader's life easier to give you points if they can make out what you wrote.

## Previous Free Response Questions
The College Board releases the Free Response Questions from all previous years. Note that _GridWorld_ problems were removed in 2015. If you ssee any problems that evolves _GirdWorld_, skip it.
